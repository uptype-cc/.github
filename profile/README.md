## Hi there 👋

This organization is committed to providing typing practice for anyone interested, regardless of skill level.

It does **not** intend to be an educational platform (for that, we recommend [TypingClub]). Rather, it is aimed at users who have already learned the basics and want to improve speed and/or accuracy for specific purposes (e.g., chat, programming, transcription, etc.).
