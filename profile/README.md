## Hi there 👋

We are committed to providing typing practice for anyone interested, regardless of skill level.

However, we do **not** aim to be an educational platform (such as [TypingClub]). Rather, we target users who have already learned the basics and want to improve their performance (i.e., speed, accuracy, or coverage) for specific purposes: chat, programming, transcription, etc.

[Try it] for free and start improving! 🚀

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
